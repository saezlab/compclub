# Computational Club

A club to discuss general topics of broad interest about computers. Basic
knowledge that facilitates our coding and system administration work.
Here you find examples presented in the club, and links to notes and slides.

## Topic plans

- Working with console and shell: startup scripts, environment variables,
  editors, especially vim
- Pypath intro: overview of its design and useful features
- Python parallelisation: maybe with help from Pau and Pablo?
- Python best practices, code review: we could do the same for R, and this
  can be a recurrent topic, as we can always find some interesting code to
  look at
- RDF, Owl, GraphQL, Sparql formats and queries: I am not too familiar with
  these, maybe we can talk in person how these can be useful
- Database management systems
- Reproduce existing analysis pipelines: I can imagine this can be useful, on
  some selected examples, maybe presented by the author
- High performance computing, cluster use
- Tutorials of our tools: learn their features, how to use them, ideas for
  future development
